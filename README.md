# EmelTV Backend

This is the companion backend service for the EmelTV frontend applications, built with Node.js and Express.

## Features

- Retrieves a secure **group token** based on the device type and API key
- Requests a **stream URL** using the group token
- Exposes a single API endpoint `/stream-url` for the frontend to retrieve the playable HLS stream
